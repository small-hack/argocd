# Argo CD Application for OpenBao

We're using our own helm chart, [jessebot/openbao-helm](https://github.com/jessebot/openbao-helm), until the official [openbao/openbao-helm](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-helm) is ready.

## Status

We're currently waiting on a few PRs before we can move forward with official support for openbao:

- https://github.com/openbao/openbao-helm/pull/2 - official releases
- https://github.com/openbao/openbao-helm/issues/3 - release includes official docker hub images
