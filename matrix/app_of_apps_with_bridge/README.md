This is an example matrix ArgoCD app of apps, which matches the other matrix app of apps, however this one includes bridges:

- [hookshot bridge](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/metrics.html) for feeds, prometheus, and github alerts
- [discord bridge](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/docker-setup.html?bridge=discord) for bridging discord with matrix
