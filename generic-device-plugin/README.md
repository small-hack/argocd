# Generic Device Plugin

This installs the [squat/generic-device-plugin](https://github.com/squat/generic-device-plugin/tree/main), which is recommended for exposing generic devices such as USB devices to your k8s pods. This can useful if you have an iot coordinator device such as the conbee 2 that you are using with deconz or home assistant. You can read more about device plugins in the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/).
