# Ingress Nginx Controller
This installs [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) which is the kubernetes hosted ingress controller using nginx, not to be confused with nginx-ingress, which is the ingress controller using nginx that is hosted by nginx itself.

We don't pass in any values. This is mainly in argo for visibily and in git so that renovate bot can update it as needed :)
